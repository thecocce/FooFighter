Foo Fighter is a Crossplatform Fighting Game project in the style of M.U.G.E.N, but designed for mobile and desktop application integration because there is nothing like putting a smackdown on someone no matter where they are.

As such, the first aim is to build a fighting platform, which can be compiled for several different platforms using Action Script3 and Flixel as the basis of the platform, followed by adding in a chat room, and multi-player functionality using the Adobe Air platform.

As such, this project is just beginning on August 24, 2010. Let the Anyone Any where Any platform Smack Downs begin.
